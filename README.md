# Natural Language Processing for Disaster Tweet Prediction

This repository focuses on addressing the Kaggle Competition, 'Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.' While the competition serves as an entry point for NLP beginners, the goal here is to develop clean and structured code rather than opting for a quick and messy approach, with the aim of achieving a high accuracy score. Your feedback and suggestions for improvement are highly encouraged.

## Project Title: Disaster-Related Tweets Classification

This project aims to classify tweets as either disaster-related or non-disaster. The dataset comprises approximately 7500 labeled tweets, and NLP techniques are employed to build a model for accurate tweet classification.

The project successfully classifies disaster-related tweets using a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning models. Evaluation is based on the F1 score, with the best model achieving an F1 score of approximately 0.98. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or suggest improvements!
